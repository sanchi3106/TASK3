# TASK3
üå∏ Task 3: Iris Flower Classification
Internship: CodSoft ‚Äì Data Science

üìå Objective:
In this task, you will work on one of the most popular and beginner-friendly datasets in the machine learning community ‚Äî the Iris Flower Dataset. Your goal is to develop a supervised machine learning model that can accurately classify iris flowers into one of three species: Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica, using features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

üìÅ Dataset Description:
The Iris dataset contains:

150 total records, 50 for each species.

4 input features:

Sepal Length (cm)

Sepal Width (cm)

Petal Length (cm)

Petal Width (cm)

1 target label:

Species (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica)

This dataset is a perfect introduction to multi-class classification problems.

üîç What You Need to Do:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Import Required Libraries
Use libraries such as:

pandas and numpy for data manipulation

matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization

scikit-learn for building and evaluating models

2Ô∏è‚É£ Load and Explore the Dataset
Load the dataset using pandas or directly from sklearn.datasets.

Check for null values, data types, and basic statistics.

Understand the relationship between features using pair plots, heatmaps, or box plots.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Preprocess the Data
Encode categorical labels (if needed).

Normalize/scale the features if using algorithms sensitive to feature magnitudes (e.g., SVM, KNN).

Split the dataset into training and testing sets (typically 80-20 or 70-30 split).

4Ô∏è‚É£ Train Machine Learning Models
Train one or more classification models such as:

Logistic Regression

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Decision Tree

Random Forest

Compare performance across these models.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Evaluate the Model
Use metrics such as:

Accuracy

Confusion Matrix

Precision, Recall, F1-Score

Classification Report

Visualize the confusion matrix and decision boundaries (if applicable).

6Ô∏è‚É£ Make Predictions
Predict the species of new Iris flowers using the trained model.

Optionally create a simple input function or interactive tool using input() or Streamlit.

üß† Learning Outcomes:
Understand multi-class classification

Gain hands-on experience with the model training process

Learn model evaluation techniques

Practice data visualization and preprocessing

Strengthen understanding of scikit-learn and machine learning workflows

üìé Deliverables:
Python Notebook (.ipynb or .py) with well-commented code

Summary of your model selection and evaluation

(Optional) Visualizations and conclusions

üîó Dataset Source:
You can find the dataset via:

sklearn.datasets.load_iris()

Or download it manually from UCI Machine Learning Repository
